  title: Multiomic Dataset from Vaccinia Infection Experiments in the Vero Cell line
  desc:  >
        The genome is dynamic and folds into complex structures and configurations
        import for cellular health and function. Here we have designed a set of
        experiments and collected data to elucidate this dynamic structure-function
        relationship, which is not well understood particularly in the context of viral
        infection. These data (published in Venu et al. 2024) include processed genomic
        sequencing data from 3D chromatin conformation experiments which included both
        Hi-C and ATAC-seq. From these data, we have generated 3D models of various
        chromosomes using methods described by our collaborators in Lappala et al 2021.
        Post processing, these data include structure files delineating 3D points in
        space, processed ATAC-seq data (which measure open chromatin states), and
        estimates of interacting chromatin. Together, this data will be used to develop
        applications for rendering 3D volumetric models of chromosomes for biological
        exploration. The results of this modeling and testing will be published in a
        report to the sponsor.
